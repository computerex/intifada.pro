This is Zionism, a settler colonial racist regime based on establishment of a Jewish majority in historic Palestine by any means necessary. Indigenous Palestinians won’t give up on their lands, hence Zionists understood that the only solution is …Force Majeure.
Quick facts on sheikh Jarrah:
-Sheikh Jarrah is a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem, located on the slopes of Mount Scopus, home to about 3,000 residents. It contains one of the highest Palestinian Muslim concentration living outside of the city.
- In the 19th century, a small Jewish community lived there most of which left by 1948, at the time of the establishment of the Zionist state of Israel and resettled there. The small jewish community includes those who rented homes but didn’t own them under the ottomans as of what is documented in some of the Istanbul ottoman archives.
- As East Jerusalem came under Jordanian rule. In 1956, 28 Palestinian families who were ethnically cleansed in 1948 from their lands by the Zionist colonialists from West Jerusalem, were settled by the UN there through an agreement reached between Jordan and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the 28 Palestinian refugee families were granted funds to build homes on land provided by the Jordanian government, provided they relinquished their right to food assistance from UNRWA.
- According to individual lease agreements between the respective families and the Jordanian authorities, the families were to pay a nominal rent for 3 years, after which ownership of the land and the properties would be transferred to them.
- However, despite assurances and the Palestinian refugees following the agreements,legal title to the homes was never formally transferred to the families.
- Immediately after the Zionist occupation of Jerusalem in 1967, it seized the house of the Al-Shanti family in the neighborhood without any decision from the courts.
-Since that year, Israeli court sessions continued, in which there was a clear evidence of collaboration with the settlement associations, as the judges refused to consider the requests of the Palestinian residents to prove ownership.
- In recent years, several of these families were evicted as a result of Israeli court decisions to recognize pre-1948 ownership claims made by settler bodies ; the Sephardic Community Committee and the Knesset Israel Committee, which enabled Jewish settlers to move into the Palestinian homes immediately.
- In 2008, the Umm Kamil al-Kurd family was displaced from their home, and in 2009 the al-Ghawi and Hanoun families were displaced, and the Nabil al-Kurd family lost half of their home. Today settler families live in their homes.
- Although implemented according to Israeli legal and justice systems, the move set a political double standard that justifies Jewish claims to property held before 1948, but DOES NOT allow Palestinians to make similar claims to properties they were FORCED to leave in West Jerusalem.
- The United Nations coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Robert Serry condemned this injustice: "These actions heighten tensions and undermine international efforts to create conditions for fruitful negotiations to achieve peace."
The US State Department called it a violation of Israel's obligations under the Road map for peace.
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said: "Tonight, while these new settlers from abroad will be accommodating themselves and their belongings in these Palestinian houses, 19 newly homeless children will have nowhere to sleep."
- In Early 2021, the Occupation Court issued a new decision giving 4 families from the neighborhood until next May to evacuate their homes, and 3 other families until August,otherwise they will be forcibly removed.
- The families of Sheikh Jarrah called on the Jordanian government to provide the necessary documents to help establish their rights to their homes and lands, Which they did.
- The Zionist occupation authorities plan to build 200 settlement units on the lands and homes of the people of Sheikh Jarrah. This scheme serves the occupation’s vision of encircling the Old City of Jerusalem with a geographic expansion of settlements, suffocating Palestinian neighborhoods, and cutting off their contiguity in order to enforce the Bantustanisation of Palestine. A policy designed to expel Palestinians, a silent form of ethnic cleansing to establish ”Maximum land, minimum Palestinians“.
