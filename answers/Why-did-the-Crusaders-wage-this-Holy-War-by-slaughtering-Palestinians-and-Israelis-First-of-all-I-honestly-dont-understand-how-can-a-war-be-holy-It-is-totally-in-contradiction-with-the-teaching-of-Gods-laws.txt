Israelis? That’s a good one.
Those who were murdered in Palestine were my ancestors: Palestinians. The majority were Palestinian Muslims to be exact. The majority of Jews were not even in historic Palestine, but in Europe and elsewhere.
Israel was founded in 1948 through ethnic cleansing and warcrimes commited by recently arriving European Zionists against native Palestinians.
What’s next? Claiming that the Native Americans were Jews or the aboriginals of Australia were Jews? Perhaps those Palestinians who were massacred and ethnically cleansed by Zionists were Jews?
Enough is enough.
