Hasbara, meaning “explaining” is Israeli public diplomacy, especially that aimed at international audiences. It seeks to spread a positive image of Israel and legitimize its actions, often through outright false talking points and demonization of Palestinians. It is a state-backed endeavor, with fellowships, organizations and other funded activities to spread it.
In short, Israeli propaganda.
