Palestinian here. Of course not, it is not wrong. I do oppose Israel's acts and policies against us, how it is oppressing us, and constantly violates our basic human rights. However, I do not despise Israelis who do not commit crimes against humanity or violate international law or are not actively harming us. Israelis are individuals, just like you and me and everyone else, and they are prone to propaganda and bias, just like everyone else. Unfortunately, Israel just has a lot of it.
