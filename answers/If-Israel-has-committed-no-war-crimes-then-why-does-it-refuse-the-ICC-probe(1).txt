Israel has a lot to hide. Its human rights abuses fill page upon page of any notebook. Whether it is about its war crimes during repeated wars against the helpless, entrapped Palestinian population in Gaza or its illegal settlement enterprise, or moving its population into illegally occupied areas, moving Palestinian prisoners into its own territory from occupied territory. Let us not forget about house demolitions, family evictions,..etc?
With that horrid track record, justice requires that Israeli violations are examined, and it faces accountability for them. Its leaders should answer for their war crimes in person and must have their day in court at The Hague. Otherwise, its leaders will continue to commit crimes, safe in the knowledge that they will not have to answer for them. The wheels of justice need to move more quickly, and then Israeli war criminals won't be able to sleep soundly every night thinking they can just get up in the morning and commit more crimes with impunity.
In contradiction to the Israeli government, both the PA, and Hamas welcomed the ICC investigation. Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, told Reuters:
“We welcome the ICC decision to investigate Israeli occupation war crimes against our people. It is a step forward on the path of achieving justice for the victims of our people.“
