Since the beginning of Israel brutal and heinous complete siege of Gaza, cutting of Palestinians from food, water, power, and medical aid, while bombing them with 6000+ bombs (equivalent to a quarter of a nuclear bomb), Zionists have been spreading propaganda, lies, and disinformation to justify the genocide of Palestinians. So far, Israel has murdered over 2700 Palestinians, including 850 children, and injured over 9000 while displacing over half a million Palestinians from their homes.

First of all, the claim that Hamas uses Palestinians as human shields is an ancient claim that has already been debunked multiple times before. There is zero evidence whatsoever that Hamas has used human shields in October, 2023 as well. Thus, this is only propaganda and lies used by Zionists to incite hate and portray Palestinians as barbaric and terrorists.
There is also zero evidence that Hamas has set any road barricades to block Palestinians from fleeing their homes in northern Gaza, where Israel is preparing to resume its war crimes through a ground invasion. Matter of fact, it was actually Israel that had ordered 1.1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza within 24 hours - an impossible demand that even the Israeli army spokesperson has admitted cannot be implemented in one day. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, had commented on this order, saying that:
With this order, Israeli forces are setting in motion the mass forced displacement of more than 1.1 million people from Gaza city and the entire northern part of the Gaza Strip. It has sowed panic among the population and left thousands of internally displaced Palestinians now sleeping on the streets, not knowing where to flee to or where they can find safety amid a relentless bombing campaign by Israel and merciless collective punishment measures. This order must be rescinded immediately.
UN expert Gaviria Betancur has also commented on the situation, calling Israel to rescind the evacuation order:
“Forcible population transfers constitute a crime against humanity, and collective punishment is prohibited under international humanitarian law. We are horrified at the prospect of an additional 1 million Palestinians joining the over 423,000 people already forcibly driven from their homes by the violence over the past week. It is inconceivable that more than half of Gaza’s population could traverse an active war zone, without devastating humanitarian consequences, particularly while deprived of essential supplies and basic services. The humanitarian system in Gaza is already at breaking point. Gaza’s infrastructure has been devastated by indiscriminate bombardments from air, land and sea, and those currently displaced have nowhere to go. Tripling the displaced population overnight will decimate and permanently alter the civilian population of Gaza. More than two-thirds of internally displaced persons are sheltering in UNRWA schools which are not fit for this purpose, and have themselves been bombarded. Over 1,400 [13th October figure] Palestinians have been killed and more than 6,000 have been injured since 7 October, leaving hospitals overwhelmed, Because there is no conceivable way for hospitals to evacuate the most serious cases, the WHO has called the evacuation order an effective ‘death sentence’ for the sick. I would like to remind Israel that observance of international law is compulsory, not optional, during any conflict,”. To that end, I call for the strict respect of international humanitarian law and its provisions, including unrestricted humanitarian access to those in need, the cessation of indiscriminate attacks against civilians, and an end to forced displacement of populations and blockade,”.
Following the illegal evacuation order, many Palestinians have decided to flee in fear of Israeli aggression, despite airstrikes and bombardment continuing to take place over the entire Gaza strip.

Israel also had informed Palestinians to take a “safe route” in which they were assured that the route wouldn’t be attacked or bombed if they take that route. The route is the the Salah Al Din road which connects the northern part of the strip to the south.

To their shock, however, Israel bombed and murdered Palestinians that attempted to take the route that Israel. In other words, Israel ordered Palestinians to leave their homes and move to south, recommended a “safe route”, then lied and murdered them while they evacuated. The bombardment targeted a convoy of civilian cars as well as vehicles carrying women and children. Most of the deaths of the incident were women and children.

20-year-old Gina described the horror of moving on the main Salah Al Din eastern road:
"I was terrified, I thought I was about to die," said Gina, crying over the phone as she described the trip to the south.
“They told us to escape and then they bomb people on the road. My father drove back to Gaza City. He said if we are dying anyway, let's be at home in Gaza,"

Aftermath of Israeli bombing on Salah Al Din street.
It should be noted that it is not unexpected of Israel to target civilians, as the vast majority of the casualties are innocent civilians, 60% of whom are women and children.
