Yes. Black and Native Americans on the one hand, and Palestinians on the other hand, have recognized affinities and have offered mutual solidarity for decades, dating back to the early days of the civil rights and Black and Native American power movements of the 1960s.

Black Panther leaders such as Fred Hampton saw the Palestinians as part of a global opposition to racism, imperialism, and predatory capitalism. Black leaders have also been concerned by Israel’s discrimination against Black Jews (from Ethiopia and elsewhere) and harsh treatment of African asylum seekers.
The synergy between Black Americans and Palestinians has been re-invigorated in recent years as activists in the U.S. and Palestine are recognizing ever more organic ties. This is especially true of the efforts to end militarized policing which has been fostered by Israel’s active training of U.S. law enforcement.

Palestinians were among the first to express solidarity with demonstrators in Ferguson in 2014, offering them guidance on how to cope with tear gas and other repressive police tactics. Palestinians were also present at the Standing Rock protest in 2016 against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

The overarching principles uniting BIPOC and Palestinian struggles are anti-racism and the quest for justice, and equal rights for all human beings, regardless of color or creed.


Elected officials should welcome efforts to strengthen solidarity between BIPOC and Palestinians in the United States and in Palestine.
