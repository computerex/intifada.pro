The historical narrative of the establishment of Israel and the ethnic cleansing of native Palestinian Arabs has roots in various factors, including the end of the Ottoman Empire, British involvement, and the aftermath of World War I and II. Here is a simplified overview:
Ottoman Empire: Before World War I, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I led to a reorganization of the Middle East.
British Mandate: The mandate of Palestine provided a golden opportunity for the Zionist movement to achieve its aims. The British were far more responsive to Zionist goals than the Ottomans were, and had earlier produced the Balfour Declaration in 1917 promising the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine. The League of Nations granted Britain the mandate to administer Palestine in 1920. During this time, European Jewish immigration to Palestine increased, leading to tensions between recent arriving European Jewish immigrants and native Palestinian Arab communities.
World War II: The Holocaust during World War II further intensified international support for a Jewish homeland.
Establishment of Israel: In 1948, Israel unilaterally declared its independence on Palestinian lands, leading to conflict with neighboring Arab states. The War of Independence (or Nakba, meaning catastrophe) resulted in massacres commited against indigenous Palestinians and the ethnic cleansing of 80% of the Palestinian populace from their lands and properties.
The ethnic cleansing of Palestinian Arabs is a central and contentious aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian ”conflict“. The consequences of these events continue to shape the dynamics of the region and discussions about refugees and their denied right of return by the the Israeli government. It's important to approach this history with sensitivity, acknowledging the diverse perspectives and experiences of those involved.
