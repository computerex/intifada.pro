The “Arabs” living in what is now called Israel are Palestinians that have been living there for thousands of years. Zionists call Palestinians who live in Israel as “Israeli Arabs”. Naturally, this is a threat to the Israeli narrative of the non-existence of Palestinians as a people, so even as they tokenize us in an attempt to prove their egalitarianism, they seek to simultaneously erase our actual identity, but to no avail.
We didn’t go to Israel, Israel came to us.
