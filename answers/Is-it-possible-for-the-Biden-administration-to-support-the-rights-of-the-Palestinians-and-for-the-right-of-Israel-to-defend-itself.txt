No phrase distorts reality more than the phrase
”Israel has the right to defend itself“.
Defend itself from what?
Native Palestinians colonized and oppressed by Israel?
From This?



Or perhaps you mean this?



The Palestinians have the right under international law to resist occupation, ethnic cleansing, annexation, aggression, and colonization. And Israel as an occupying power can not justify military force as self defense in territory for which it is responsible for as the occupant. By definition, an aggressor can not act in defense. Israel is asserting rights that may be consistent with colonial domination but simply do not exist under International Law.
General Assembly Resolution A/RES/3246 (XXIX) of 29 November 1974:
Reaffirms the legitimacy of the peoples’ struggle for liberation from colonial and foreign domination and alien subjugation by all available means, including armed struggle; and strongly condemns all Governments which do not recognize the right to self-determination and independence of peoples under colonial and foreign domination and alien subjugation, notably the peoples of Africa and the Palestinian people.
United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/33/24 of 29 November 1978:
Reaffirms the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence, territorial integrity, national unity and liberation from colonial and foreign domination and foreign occupation by all available means, particularly armed struggle.”
The mainstream US media outlets are actively concealing the alarming displays of genocidal racism emanating from Israeli Jewish society. Violence against Palestinians is nothing new. Israel’s ongoing colonial project requires enormous levels of brutality against Palestinians. But this daily reality is only newsworthy when it blows back against Zionists.
In my personal opinion I believe in peaceful and non-violent resistance.
