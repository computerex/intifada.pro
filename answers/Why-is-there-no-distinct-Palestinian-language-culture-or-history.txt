Question is based on a false premise.
Palestinian history, language, and culture are rich and complex, with roots stretching back thousands of years.
History: Palestinians are the native inhabitants of historic Palestine, which is roughly equivalent to modern-day Israel (historic Palestine), the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. The history of Palestine is long and varied, with a succession of empires and kingdoms ruling the area over the centuries since time immemorial. In the modern era, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire until the end of World War I, when it was placed under British control as a mandate. In 1948, Israel declared its independence on Palestinian lands, leading to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in what is known as the Nakba, or catastrophe. Since then, Palestinians have been fighting for their right to self-determination and an independent state.
Language: Palestine has been inhabited by various peoples throughout history, and as a result, a wide range of languages have been spoken there with a rich linguistic history, shaped by the many cultures and peoples who have inhabited it over the centuries.
In ancient times, the Canaanite language family was dominant in the region, with languages such as Hebrew, Phoenician, and Amorite being spoken. These languages evolved over time and were influenced by the languages of neighboring peoples, such as Aramaic and Greek. Aramaic became widely spoken during the Persian and Hellenistic periods. Aramaic continued to be spoken in Palestine during the early Islamic period, alongside Greek and Hebrew.
During the Islamic period in the 7th century, Arabic became the dominant language in the region it has evolved over time, influenced by other languages and dialects, such as Turkish and Kurdish during the Ottoman period and it remains the primary language spoken in Palestine today. However, there are also significant minority populations who speak other languages, such as Armenian, Russian, and various dialects of Aramaic, which have been spoken in the region for thousands of years. Palestinian Christians often speak a form of Palestinian Arabic that incorporates Aramaic vocabulary and grammar.
During the British Mandate period (1917-1948), English also became an important language in Palestine, and it continues to be widely spoken today, particularly among educated and professional populations.
The Palestinian dialect of Arabic has evolved over time through a combination of historical, social, economic, and linguistic factors. The region's history of political and cultural diversity, the influence of neighboring languages dialects, such as Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek, have left their mark on Palestinian Arabic. The dialect continues to evolve and adapt to new linguistic and cultural influences.
Today, the linguistic landscape of the region reflects this complex history, with a diverse range of languages and dialects spoken by the various communities that call Palestine home.
Culture: Palestinian culture is diverse and complex, influenced by various historical, religious, and political factors. It is deeply rooted in the land of Palestine and its people, who have a rich history dating back thousands of years.
The cultural and linguistic heritage of the Palestinian people is a blend of both indigenous Canaanite, and the Phoenician elements and the foreign cultures that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years.
Cultural contributions to the fields of art, literature, music, architecture, costume and cuisine express the Palestinian identity despite the geographical separation between the Palestinians from the Palestinian territories, Palestinian citizens of historic Palestine, now called Israel and Palestinians in the diaspora.

Another important aspect of Palestinian culture is its cuisine, which is renowned for its unique flavors and use of local ingredients. Palestinian cuisine draws on a range of culinary influences, including Arabic, Mediterranean, and Ottoman cuisine. Popular dishes include hummus, falafel, maqluba (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), and shawarma (grilled meat served in a wrap or pita bread).
Music and dance are also integral parts of Palestinian culture, with traditional forms of music and dance still being performed at weddings, festivals, and other cultural events.
