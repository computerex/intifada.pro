Israel invaded the Palestinian West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip in 1967, and has imposed brutal military rule ever since. This means that for the past 56 years, Israel has ruled over all of original Palestine.
Palestinians in the West Bank are subjected to Israeli military rule with no rights. Palestinians are all affected by Israeli violence, land theft, home demolitions, and other human rights abuses.
Israel has imposed a 16-year siege on the Palestinian Gaza Strip, denying over 2 million Palestinians adequate food, clean water, medicine, electricity, and the freedom to travel. Israel also frequently bombs Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip who are trapped and unable to leave, killing thousands of civilians.
BY THE NUMBERS:
As of 2020, 674,000 Israeli settlers lived in approximately 300 illegal Israeli settlements. All of these settlements are war crimes under international law.
Since 1967, over 55,000 Palestinian homes in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.
Since 2008, repeated Israeli attacks against 2 million Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip have killed more than 4,000 Palestinians, the vast majority of whom were civilians.
