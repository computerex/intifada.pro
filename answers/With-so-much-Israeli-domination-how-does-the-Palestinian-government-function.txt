All of the answers here are mostly by Zionists. Every single one of them. The Hasbara propaganda army is not on a leash today. Israel controls everything from the river to the sea, the current PA listens to what the Israeli government says. It is literally an extension of the Israeli occupation. The PA only pays wages for Palestinians trying to earn a living, they generally don’t do anything besides that. They don’t and can not protect Palestinians from Israeli aggression. An IDF soldier can enter Ramallah, literally slap the hell out of any PA official, and no one can do anything about it. The PA President needs to ask permission from Israel to travel between Palestinian cities in an area he is “supposed” to rule. Israel is an apartheid state. This is the reality.
