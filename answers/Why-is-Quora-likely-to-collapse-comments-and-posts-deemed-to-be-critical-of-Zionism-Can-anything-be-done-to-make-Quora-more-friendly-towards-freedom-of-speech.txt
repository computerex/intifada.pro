Quora clearly collapses Palestinian and pro Palestinian voices.
Here is my experience:
Since I Joined and started participating in Quora , more than half of my answers about Palestine submitted at different times were collapsed. I had to submit dozens of appeals!
I strictly follow Quoraâ€™s policy, my answers are very thorough and well documented, yet most of the time they get collapsed without any notification or a valid reason whatsoever.














My latest three answers are still collapsed.
