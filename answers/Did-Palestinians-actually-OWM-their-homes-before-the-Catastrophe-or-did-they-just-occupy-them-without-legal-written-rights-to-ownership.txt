Regarding Sheikh Jarrah:
– Sheikh Jarrah is a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem, located on the slopes of Mount Scopus, home to about 3,000 residents. It contains one of the highest Palestinian Muslim concentrations living outside of the city.
– In the 19th century, a small Jewish community lived there among the Muslim majority, these Jewish families left by 1948, at the time of the establishment of the Zionist state of Israel, and resettled there in other regions in colonized Palestine. The small Jewish community includes those who rented homes but didn’t own them under the ottomans as of what is documented in some of the Istanbul Ottoman archives.
– In the early 20th century, wealthy Palestinian families moved to build modern houses in the area, escaping the narrow streets and the hustle and bustle of their air-tight homes in the Old City.
– The neighborhood’s name refers to the personal physician of the Islamic general Saladin, who is believed to have settled there when Muslim armies captured the city from Christian crusaders in 1187.
– As East Jerusalem came under Jordanian rule. In 1956, 28 Palestinian families who were ethnically cleansed in 1948 from their lands by the Zionist colonialists from West Jerusalem, were settled by the UN there through an agreement reached between Jordan and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the 28 Palestinian refugee families agreed to a deal with the Jordanian government that would make them the owners of the land and houses, receiving official land deeds signed in their names after three years. In return, they would renounce their refugee status.
– However, the deal was cut short as Israel captured and illegally occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and Jordan lost control of the territories.
– Immediately after the Zionist occupation of Jerusalem in 1967, it seized the house of the Al Shanti family in the neighborhood withoutany decision from the courts.
– Since that year, Israeli court sessions continued, in which there was clear evidence of collaboration with the settlement associations, as the judges refused to consider the requests of the Palestinian residents to prove ownership.
– In recent years, several of these families were evicted as a result of Israeli court decisions to recognize pre-1948 ownership claims made by settler bodies; the Sephardic Community Committee and the Knesset Israel Committee, which enabled Jewish settlers to move into the Palestinian homes immediately.
– Israelis have made similar claims to owning Palestinian lands that lie less than a kilometer away from the Old City of Jerusalem. Israel has a grand settlement strategy called the “Holy Basin,” which is a set of settler units and a string of parks themed after biblical places and figures around the Old City of Jerusalem. The plan requires the removal of Palestinian houses in the area.
– In 1982, Israeli settler groups asked the Israeli court to evict 24 Palestinian families living in Shiekh Jarrah. In 1991, the families faced another twist when they accused their Israeli lawyer and legal representative of forging their signatures on documents in 1991 stating that the ownership of the lands belonged to the settlers. Since then,Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah had been treated as tenants in front of the Israel courts, facing removal orders to allow the way for settlers to take over their houses.
– In 2002, 43 Palestinians were evicted from the area and Israeli settlers took over their properties.
– In 2005, the Israeli court dismissedOttoman documents presented by Suleiman Darwish Hijazi, one of the residents of Sheikh Jarrah, as evidence of his ownership of the land.
– In 2008, the Umm Kamil al-Kurd family was displaced from their home, in 2009 the al-Ghawi and Hanoun families were displaced,and the Nabil al-Kurd family lost half of their home, and in 2017 the Shamasneh family was also removed from their home by Israeli settlers. Today, settler families live in their homes.
– Palestinians had called for Jordan to release official papers and documents to prove their ownership. In April/2021,Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi handed over documents provingPalestinian ownership of their properties in Sheikh Jarrah, in a bid to prevent a new mass eviction. Israeli courts rejected them.
– Although implemented according to Israeli legal and justice systems, the move set a political double standard that justifies Jewish claims to property held before 1948, but DOES NOT allow Palestinians to make similar claims to hundreds of thousands of properties and lands they were FORCED to leave in West Jerusalem.
– The United Nations coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Robert Serry condemned this injustice:
“These actions heighten tensions and undermine international efforts to create conditions for fruitful negotiations to achieve peace.”
– The US State Department called it a violation of Israel’s obligations under the Road map for peace.
– Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said:
“Tonight, while these new settlers from abroad will be accommodating themselves and their belongings in these Palestinian houses, 19 newly homeless children will have nowhere to sleep.”
– In Early 2021, the Occupation Court issued a new decision giving 4 families from the neighborhood until next May to evacuate their homes, and 3 other families until August,otherwise they will be forcibly removed.
– The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR), on 7/5/2021, called on Israel to immediately halt all forced evictions, including those in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem, as well as to exercise maximum restraint in the use of force while ensuring safety and security there.
– The Zionist occupation authorities plan to build 200 settlement units on the lands and homes of the Palestinian people of Sheikh Jarrah. This scheme serves the occupation’s vision of encircling the Old City of Jerusalem with a geographic expansion of settlements, suffocating Palestinian neighborhoods, and cutting off their contiguity to enforce the Bantustanisation of Palestine. A policy designed to expel Palestinians, a silent form of ethnic cleansing to establish ”Maximum land, minimum Palestinians“.
