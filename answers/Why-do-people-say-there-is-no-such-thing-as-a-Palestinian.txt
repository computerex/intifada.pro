If someone doesn’t exist, any crime against him/her would be justified, that’s settler colonial logic which is inherent to a 19th century European settler colonial movement known as : Zionism.
Even now, Zionists call Palestinians who live in Israel as “Israeli Arabs”. Naturally, this is a threat to the Israeli narrative of the non-existence of Palestinians as a people, so even as they tokenize us in an attempt to prove their egalitarianism, they seek to simultaneously erase our actual identity, but to no avail.
