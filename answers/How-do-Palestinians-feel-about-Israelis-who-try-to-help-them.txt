I have never ever got any personal help from any Israeli, not even once. I was harassed, humiliated, and attacked multiple times by Israeli soldiers and illegal Zionist settlers since childhood and until this present day. In contrast, I provided medical care for Israelis, and once there was a horrific accident where I provided first aid and resuscitation to illegal Israeli settlers and their poor child.
