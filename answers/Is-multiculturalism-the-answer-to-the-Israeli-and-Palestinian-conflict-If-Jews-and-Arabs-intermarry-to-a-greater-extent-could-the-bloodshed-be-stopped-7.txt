Expelling Palestinians to Arab countries, annexing the occupied West Bank to Israel, calling for a ban on Christmas, urging a Jewish-Israeli model not to marry Leonardo DiCaprio: these are just a few of the most attention-grabbing demands of Lehava, a far-right, anti-Palestinian Israeli organisation, whose followers rallied recently in occupied East Jerusalem, shouting “Death to Arabs”.
Lehava, which means "flame" in Hebrew, is the acronym for "Prevention of Assimilation in the Holy Land".
