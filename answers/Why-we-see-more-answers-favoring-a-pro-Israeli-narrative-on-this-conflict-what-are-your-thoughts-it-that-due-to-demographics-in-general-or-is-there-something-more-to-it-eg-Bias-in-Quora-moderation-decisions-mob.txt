A couple of reasons:
1- Clear bias in Quora’s moderation decisions, more than 150 of my answers were collapsed since I became active on Quora. All you need to do is look at a couple of my recent answers that are still collapsed without a valid reason or even a notification.
2- Palestinians don’t have the privilege or the time to be active on Quora, they are barely trying to survive under a brutal Zionist Colonial regime.
3- Ultimately, what is right and wrong is clear. Who’s cause is righteous and who’s narrative is false is obvious. Repeating the same old debunked Zionist myths won’t make them true. Palestinians don’t have the time to waste on fictitious Zionist colonial notions.
