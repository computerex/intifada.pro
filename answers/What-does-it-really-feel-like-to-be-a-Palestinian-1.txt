This is what I recorded in my diary 2 days ago.
16/11- Tuesday
6:08 am: Woke up, had a shower , ate my breakfast, packed my stuff , and went to work.
6:55 am: There is a huge traffic in front of village X in Palestine, the cars are not moving. It turned out to be an Israeli checkpoint at the entrance of my area I live in.
7:47 am: Israeli soldiers stopped me:
Soldier: Sabah alkheer, Men ween inta ( Arabic , Good morning, where are you from?)
Me: X.
Soldier: Ahhhh…. X, btehki ebri ( Arabic, do you speak Hebrew?)
Me: No, I speak English or Arabic
Soldier: [Give me your] hawyiyeh ( Arabic, ID).
Me: There you go.
Soldier: Tell your children to not throw stones next time.
What I wanted to say:
You put an illegal checkpoint in front of a Palestinian village, in an area you are not supposed to be in to impose collective punishment on its inhabitants, since you started building an illegal military road in Palestinian lands in the past months, took Palestinian properties by force, and you expect no retaliation to Palestinians being enforced into more Bantustans? This is Settler colonialism! This is Apartheid! Fuck you.
Me: I have no children, I am a doctor and I am late to work.
Soldier: Giggling with another soldier…. waving his hand to let me pass.
9:07 am: Reached work an hour late.
