Here is an example of a book by an Israeli Jewish author that was banned.

Description: Painful truths about the Zionist rape of Palestine and deliberate planting of anti-Semitism in Iraqi Jewish communities during David Ben-Gurion's political career to persuade Iraqi Jews to immigrate to Israel. The Zionists' goal was to import raw Jewish labor from the Middle East to farm the newly-vacated lands and fill the military ranks with conscripts, to defend the stolen lands.


It’s worth mentioning Sally Rooney, a heroine who decided not to sell the translation rights to an Israel-based publisher due to her support for an economic and cultural boycott of Israeli companies and institutions complicit in the violation of Palestinian human rights.
“I simply do not feel it would be right for me under the present circumstances to accept a new contract with an Israeli company that does not publicly distance itself from apartheid and support the UN-stipulated rights of the Palestinian people,”
-Sally Rooney

In response, Sally Rooney's books were removed from Israeli stores.
