Saying that the Nakba ended in 1948 is not a myth propagated by the usual anti-Palestinian voices, who tend to deny that the Nakba happened at all. However, what is important to flag is not only that the Nakba happened, but that it is still happening. Settler colonialism is a structure, not an event, and the history of the Zionist movement bears this out.
Palestinians speak of the ongoing Nakba to encapsulate Israel’s continuing dispossession and displacement of the indigenous population after 1948. This is done by way of forcible evictions, land grab, house demolitions, denial of residency rights, and discriminatory planning and zoning. While most notable in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, such moves are also conducted against ’48 Palestinians (citizens) inside Israel.
Unfortunately, the Nakba is ongoing even this past week, with the Israeli army’s aforementioned attack on Jenin. The offensive compelled as many as 4,000 Palestinians to flee the camp, making them twice- or even thrice-refugees — with no sign of their displacement being resolved any time soon.
