Yes. It was a terrible deal for us. Now we live under Israel’s apartheid. I will explain how disastrous Oslo was and still for us, so bear with me:
In 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the first of a series of agreements known as the Oslo Accords. The US-sponsored Oslo process created the Palestinian Authority (PA), which was supposed to be a temporary body preceding a final peace agreement to be reached by 1999. However, instead of rolling back its occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, and allowing Palestinians to create a state, Israel entrenched the occupation and deepened its control over our lives, taking more and more of our lands for Jewish settlements and imposing harsh restrictions on our movements. Today, more than two decades after it began, many of us Palestinians consider the Oslo “peace process” a disaster.
Since the Oslo process began in 1993, Israel has:
Implanted over 450,000: Number of Israeli settlers living illegally on occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank. (Additionally, there are more than 225,000 Jewish settlers living illegally on occupied Palestinian land in East Jerusalem). Approximately 11,000 of the illegal settlers in the West Bank are located in the Jordan Valley. Additionally, over 25,000 Israeli settlers live illegaly in the occupied syrian Golan Heights. There are 279: Number of official Israeli settlements built in violation of international law on occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank, an area smaller than the state of Delaware. There are also over 147 so-called settlement “outposts,” or new small settlements built without official approval but with the support and assistance of the Israeli government.
Divided and isolated Palestinian population centers in the occupied territories from one another and the outside world, creating easily controllable cantons using strategically located settlements, walls, Israeli-only roads, and military checkpoints. Today, Israel’s illegal settlement enterprise covers approximately 42% of the occupied West Bank.

Built a ring of settlements and a wall around the expanded boundaries of occupied East Jerusalem, severing it from the West Bank, cementing Israeli control over the city and preventing most Palestinians on the outside from entering to worship, visit family and friends, do business, or study. Once a center of religious, cultural and economic life for Palestinians in the West Bank, now most aren’t allowed to enter Jerusalem.
Imposed severe restrictions on Palestinian movement, to and from and within the occupied territories, including a permit system, network of military checkpoints, and the illegal siege and blockade of Gaza. These restrictions have caused great hardships for people, preventing them from accessing medical care, students from going to school, farmers from reaching their land, obstructing the conduct of business and commence, and separating families and friends.
Suffocated the Palestinian economy, particularly in Gaza, with restrictions on the movement of people and goods, the destruction of agricultural lands, restrictions on fishing, frequent curfews and closures, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure during military operations. As a result, the PA and Palestinians in the occupied territories are largely dependent on international aid and taxes that are collected and returned by Israel under the terms of Oslo.



Turned Palestinians into one of the most policed people on earth, using its army and PA police forces to suppress dissent against Israel's military rule. Today, more of the PA’s budget goes into its paramilitary police than into education, health care, and the agriculture sector combined.
Destroyed more than 15,000 Palestinian structures in the occupied territories, including homes, businesses, irrigation and water collection systems, barns and other agricultural buildings, This figure doesn’t include more than 20,000 Palestinian homes destroyed during military assaults.
Killed nearly 10000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, including more than 2,000 children. These include deaths caused by military operations as well as attacks from settlers and other Israeli extremists.
This is what the Oslo disaster brought to us: APARTHEID.
