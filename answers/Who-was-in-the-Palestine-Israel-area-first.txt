The Palestinians are the indigenous people of Palestine; their local roots are deeply embedded in the soil of Palestine and their autochthonous identity and historical heritage long preceded the emergence of a local Palestinian nascent national movement in the late Ottoman period and the advent of Zionist settler‚Äëcolonialism before the First World War.
The Palestinians are the descendants of all the indigenous peoples who lived in Palestine over the centuries, including Canaanites since time immemorial. Since the seventh century, they have been predominantly Muslim in religion and almost completely Arab in language and culture.
As a Palestinian still living there since my birth, I can trace my lineage to 11 generations back, here in the same area I currently live in.
I read some of the answers written by Zionists and I find it humorous that they believe that before WWI, Hawaii, Lebanon, Syria, Tahiti, and Iraq were all inhabited by an indigenous population. However, they have a difficult time imagining that the ‚ÄúPromised Land‚Äù had any indigenous inhabitants. It‚Äôs as if Palestine has been waiting for over 2,000 years for Zionists to settle in and make it bloom, an another myth that was dismantled long time ago.

Unfortunately, many Zionists abhor the idea of an indigenous Palestinian people to the point of creating a fictional world based on deception. In that regard, the Palestinian people have a clear message: Over 13.5 million Palestinians are not going away. The sooner Zionists comprehend this straightforward message, the more quickly they will wake up from their coma.
