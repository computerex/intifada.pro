The Biden administration has committed rhetorically to centering human rights in US foreign policy. But when it comes to Palestine/Israel, the Biden administration has continued long-standing policies of enabling Israeli human rights abuses against Palestinians by failing to apply relevant US laws and enabling Israel’s abuses through diplomatic protection at the UN. Even when Israel has committed gross human rights violations against Palestinian Americans, the United States has failed to hold Israel accountable. This selective concern with human rights is most evident when we compare US policy toward Russia’s military occupation, annexation, and war crimes in Ukraine with Israel’s military occupation, annexation, and war crimes in Palestine.
The United States enables Israel’s human rights abuses against Palestinians by giving Israel weapons, by vetoing resolutions in the UN condemning Israeli human rights abuses and by criticizing and attempting to block UN investigatory bodies, by refusing to acknowledge this is an issue of an oppressor and the oppressed, and by failing to take any meaningful action to pressure Israel to halt policies, such as settlement expansion, which the US claims to oppose.




Israel’s human rights abuses against Palestinians violate US law. The Foreign Assistance Act prohibits the US from giving any type of funding to a country that engages in a systematic pattern of gross violations of human rights. The Arms Export Control Act limits the use of US weapons primarily to internal security and legitimate self-defense, as well as a few other narrowly defined uses. The “Leahy Laws” prohibit US weapons from going to any military unit that has committed a gross human rights violation. However, in the case of Israel’s well-documented systematic human rights abuses against Palestinians, none of these laws have ever been invoked to hold Israel accountable for its actions.
Even when Israel has killed American citizens, the US often has failed to even investigate these cases, much less hold Israel accountable. In 2022, Israeli soldiers killed Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh while she was reporting, and 80-year-old Omar Assad while returning from a visit with family members in his village. In previous years, Israel killed US citizens attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and to protect Palestinian homes from being destroyed. Except in the case of Shireen Abu Akleh, no investigation has ever been launched into any case of a US citizen being killed by Israel.
