No.
The Palestinians are descendants of ancient civilizations and religions that lived in the region for centuries, including Canaanites who came from the Arabian peninsula and the East.
The origins of Palestinians are diverse. They are a meta-ethnicity. The region was not ðŸ’¯ originally Arab nor Jewish â€“ its Arabization was a consequence of the inclusion of Palestine within the rapidly expanding Arab Empire conquered by Arabian tribes and their local allies in the first millennium, most significantly during the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century. However an Arabian kingdom, the kingdom of Qedar, was present in Palestine about 800 BCE.
The term "Arab", as well as the presence of Arabians in the Syrian Desert and the Fertile Crescent, is first seen in the Assyrian sources from the 9th century BCE.
The Qedarite Kingdom, or Qedar (Arabic: Ù…Ù…Ù„ÙƒØ© Ù‚ÙŠØ¯Ø§Ø±â€Ž, romanized: Mamlakat Qaydar, also known as Qedarites), was a largely nomadic, ancient Arab tribal confederation. Described as "the most organized of the Northern Arabian tribes", at the peak of its power in the 6th century BCE it had a kingdom and controlled a vast region in Arabia.
Iâ€™m the matter of fact, Arab populations had existed in Palestine before Islamic conquests, and some of these local Arab tribes and Bedouin fought as allies of Byzantium in resisting the invasion, which the archaeological evidence indicates was a 'peaceful conquest', and the newcomers were allowed to settle in the old urban areas.
The Palestinians are the indigenous people of Palestine; their local roots are deeply embedded in the soil of Palestine and their autochthonous identity and historical heritage long preceded the emergence of a local Palestinian nascent national movement in the late Ottoman period and the advent of Zionist settlerâ€‘colonialism before the First World War.
