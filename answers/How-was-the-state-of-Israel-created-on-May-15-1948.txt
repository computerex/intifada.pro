Israel unilaterally declared its independence (from what, beats me) on Palestinian lands, ethnically cleansed at least 300 thousand Palestinian, and conducted massacres against indigenous Palestinian natives BEFORE any Arab rescue army entered Palestine. Between 750,000 and one million (80% of the native Palestinian populace at that time) was the number of Palestinians expelled and made refugees by Zionist paramilitaries, and subsequently Israeli forces, during Israelâ€™s creation in 1947-49.
Israel was established through warfare and the creation of facts on the ground. Facts it created through the massacre of Palestinians and the ethnic cleansing of hundreds of villages. This is how the modern state of Israel came into the world, and no amount of sophistry or euphemization can lend that any legitimacy.
