Yes. I wish it was only that. She said:
“There are places where the character of the State of Israel as a Jewish state must be maintained and this sometimes comes at the expense of equality.”
During the April 2019 election campaign, then-Minister of Justice Shaked released an ad depicting herself as a model in a perfume commercial, spraying herself with a scent labeled “Fascism.” At the end, she declared to the camera: “To me, it smells like democracy.”
In July 2014, Shaked posted an article on Facebook written by a former Netanyahu advisor referring to Palestinian children as “snakes” and calling for genocide against Palestinians. It read in part:
“What’s so horrifying about understanding that the entire Palestinian people is the enemy?... They are all enemy combatants, and their blood shall be on all their heads. Now this also includes the mothers of the martyrs, who send them to hell with flowers and kisses. They should follow their sons, nothing would be more just. They should go, as should the physical homes in which they raised the snakes. Otherwise, more little snakes will be raised there.”

Isn’t she lovely?
