Simply because Israel can. Israel follow the motto of might makes right. In 1947â€“1950 newly arriving European immigrant Zionists stole most of Palestine and ethnically cleansed 80% of the native Palestinian populace(at least 750 thousand).


In 1967 Israel took the rest of Palestine, and expelled another 350 thousand Palestinian native.


Here are some of the main ways in which Israel is stealing land from Palestinians after 1967:
Illegal Settlements: Israel has established Jewish settlements in the occupied territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which are considered illegal under international law. These settlements are built on Palestinian land and often involve the confiscation of Palestinian property, including homes and farmland.
Annexation: In 2020, Israel annexed parts of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, in a move that was widely criticized by the international community. This has further diminished the amount of land available for Palestinians to build homes, farm, and live on.
Apartheid Wall and illegal checkpoints: Israel has constructed a separation barrier, often referred to as the "Apartheid wall," which runs through the West Bank, separating Palestinian communities from each other and from their land. Israel also maintains numerous illegal checkpoints throughout the occupied territories, which restrict the movement of Palestinians and make it difficult for them to access their own land.
Home demolitions: Israel frequently demolishes Palestinian homes in the occupied territories, often claiming that they were built without permits. However, it is extremely difficult to near impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits, and the demolition of homes has led to the displacement of thousands of Palestinians.
Military control: Israel exercises military control over the occupied territories, which gives it the power to expropriate Palestinian land for military purposes and to restrict Palestinian access to land deemed a "closed military zone."
