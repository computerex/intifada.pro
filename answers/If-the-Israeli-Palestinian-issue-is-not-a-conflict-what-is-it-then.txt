Israel is waging a settler-colonial war to displace the indigenous Palestinian people with Jewish settlers by force and violence. Like all peoples faced with settler colonialism, Palestinians have resisted their displacement by any and all means at their disposal.

Like other colonizers, Israel has justified its settler-colonial war on Palestinians by depicting itself as upholding liberal democracy and depicting Palestinian resistance as primitive and barbaric.
