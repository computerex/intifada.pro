Area C covers 60% of the West Bank and is home to an estimated 180,000-300,000 Palestinians and to an illegal settler population of at least 325,500 living in 125 illegal settlements and approx. 100 illegal outposts. Israel retains control of security and land-management in Area C and views the area as there to serve its own needs, such as military training, economic interests and settlement development. Ignoring Palestinian needs, Israel practically bans Palestinian construction and development. At the same time, it encourages the development of Israeli settlements through a parallel planning mechanism, and the Civil Administration deliberately turns a blind eye to settlersâ€™ building violations.
