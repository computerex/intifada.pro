The mainstream usage of the term occupation refers to the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 war. These areas remain occupied to this day and are ruled de facto by Israel, who controls most aspects of Palestinian life, down to determining who a Palestinian citizen is. It should be noted that Palestinians do not differentiate morally between the take-over of parts of Palestine in 1948 or 1967, as all of it is stolen, colonized land.
