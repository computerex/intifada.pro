I agree with their moral and just decision. It is a step in the right direction in ending the company’s complicity in Israel’s occupation and violations of Palestinian rights.

Israel rules over the lives of all people living between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea, and denies Palestinians their rights. We live under blockade, occupation, and apartheid. No company should profit off apartheid and settler-colonialism.
Kudos to Ben & Jerry’s.
