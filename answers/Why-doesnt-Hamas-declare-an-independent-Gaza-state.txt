Gaza is Part of Palestine. It is an indivisible unit.
Of the 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza, 70% of them are refugees who were ethnically cleansed by Zionists from their lands and properties in neighboring Palestinian cities, and villages.

Why doesn’t Zionists declare Tel Aviv built on Yaffa in Palestine a state, and give the rest back to Palestinians?
Divide and conquer tactics will not work.
