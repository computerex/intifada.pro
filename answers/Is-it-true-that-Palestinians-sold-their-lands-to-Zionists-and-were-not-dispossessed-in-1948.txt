In yet another attempt to legitimize the Israeli take-over of Palestine, it was put forward by advocates of Israel that Palestinians had simply sold their land to the Zionist movement. Later, after witnessing how these lands were transformed into a paradise, Palestinians came to regret their decision and claimed that Israel stole their land. This conveniently ties together multiple Zionist myths and talking points into one neat package.

While this fairytale would certainly appeal to anyone trying to morally absolve themselves from the implications of their expropriation of large swathes of territory, unfortunately for them, detailed land purchase records exist. I’m sure you can already tell that these records dispel this ridiculous assertion.
The British were meticulous record keepers, and I have detailed numbers of the land purchased by the various Zionist organizations:

For reference, Mandatory Palestine as a whole had a territory of 26,625,600 dunams. The most generous estimations of Zionist land holdings were 2,000,000 dunums by 1948. For reference, a dunam is 1000 square meters. An acre is four dunams.
As you can see, at most the combined Zionist purchasing power could barely acquire 5-7% of the land, depending on source. Needless to say, huge swathes of it being strewn around the entire territory and being non-contiguous. Due to the ease with which this talking point can be debunked, it gradually fell out of favor -relatively speaking- among Israelis. However, it has since seen a resurgence among Arab Zionists desperate for normalization with Israel. In their eyes, this myth needs to be true so that they can blame the Palestinians for their own dispossession and legitimize their cynical political maneuvering.
1- Palestine’s Jewish population was under 8% of the total population as of 1914 (Righteous Victims, p. 83) and Jewish land owner in 1914 was under 2% (Benny Morris, p. 170). It should be noted that the mass majority of the Jews residing in Palestine were not citizens of the country, but they recently fled anti-Semitic Tsarist Russia .
2- Despite the active British assistance to establish a “Jewish National home” in Palestine (based on the British commitment in the Balfour Declaration),It should be noted that as of 1948: 1) Jews were a 1/3 of the total population and only a 1/6th of those gained Palestinian citizenship (meaning 8-9% of the total)! 2) Jewish land ownership in Palestine was under 7% ( Majority of those lands were bought from absentee landlords ) (Benny Morris, p. 170). Over 90% of Jewish-owned lands were titled in the name of a corporation (JNF -- formerly Palestine Colonization Company); which is neither a citizen nor an individual, which explains why you will rarely find such pre-Nakba land deeds for Jews! 3)You can see the original UN map below that was revised after Nakba in August 1950 showing more details. 4) Palestinians who are Israeli citizens (22% of the total population) are restricted to under 3% of the lands. 5)Just in case you distrust British Mandate sources, here is the founder of the "Jewish state" David Ben-Gurion confirming similar data as late as Jan. 1966 who professed also that Palestinians are descendants of the Israelites! 6) And if you are curious, here is a growing list of Palestinian land deeds. In this regard, it is telling how I found only a handful of land deeds for the Jewish citizens of Palestine during the pre-nakba period. I wonder: do Palestinians have the right to resist those who have been squattering on their lands for the past 76 years? Why usurpers of Palestinian lands have the "right of self-defense" but Palestinians don't? It’s worth noting that even after seven decades of ethnic cleansing, occupation, and dispossession, the demographic ratio between Palestinians and Israeli Jews is still the same as it was in December 1947, which was (and still is) 2 to 1 in favor of the Palestinian people. However, for Israel to maintain its democratic “Jewish state”, and above all its “Jewish character”, it opted to ETHNICALLY CLEANSE more than 80% of the Palestinian people out of their homes, farms, businesses.

As you contemplate this map and the below figures, please keep in mind that A)Beersheba was not subject to Land Settlement of Title (a.k.a. farzz) law yet as of Nakba; that is why large parts were designated as public. It should be NOTED that as of Nakba, only 17% (4,500 sq. km./26,320 sq. km.) of the lands came under the Land Settlement of Title. B) Public Lands doesn't imply that the land can be freely disposed (a.k.a. tassarouf) of by the government unless the land deed was issued (as you will see below state-owned lands were under 1%). The state officially owns the land ONLY when a land deed (title) has been issued and all claims have been settled (note the court system was filled with such claims even during Nakba), for the details please read the Survey of Palestine pages 225 to 229 with regards to miri(unregistered private --a.k.a. usufruct -- lands which were held by the state but with no tassarouf right) land classification, pay attention to this collection of land deeds where much of them were originally miri lands when they came under the land settlement law. In a nutshell, the state is just the holding legal entity (meaning that the state has no tassarouf right) until the land comes under the land settlement of title and all claims are settled; that is how land settlement happens not just in Palestine but all over the world. C) When you examine the primary source (Village Statistics of 1945, p. 33) you will see that public lands for Beersheba were much smaller (pay attention to the last 12 columns), therefore we believe the map must be wrong in the case of Beersheba. D) Beersheba (Negev) was populated and owned by Palestinian tribes at a rate of 99%, and Jews made up under 1% (much of whom were not citizens of the country) of Beersheba's population. Keep in mind that Zionist Jews to this date STILL teach their kids that 1% of the population in Negev managed to reverse global warming and bloomed the desert.




The great theft:
This talking point is further undermined by Israel’s own legislation and policy following the Nakba. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine would not stop after the war of 1948, Palestinians in the Naqab, as well as those close to the ceasefire lines would continue to face mass expulsions into the 1950s. In the same period, Israel issued the infamous Absentee’s Property Law. This law was instrumental in systematically seizing the property of all the refugees it had created, this included their homes, farms, land and even the contents of their bank accounts. Through this law, the state took control of everything remaining behind when the refugees were expelled, and if not contested or claimed, they would then become the property of the state, free to be utilized in any way it saw fit. Given the fact that any refugee attempting to return was shot, you can see how this law served merely as a fig leaf to legitimize what can only be described as naked theft. A step which would be unnecessary had the Zionists actually purchased the land on which Israel was erected, as some ridiculously claim.
This in conjunction with the Land Acquisitions Law allowed for the mass transfer of the entire Palestinian economy to the Israeli state. Practically overnight, the state gained control of over 739,750 agricultural acres, vast majority of which were of excellent quality, 73,000 houses, 7800 workshops and 6 million pounds. This dropped the cost of settling a Zionist family in Palestine from 8000$ to 1500$, effectively subsidizing the creation of the Israeli state and kickstarting its economy.
So, while we have already shown that the record shows no such large-scale purchase of the land as asserted, let us take a deeper look at these smaller purchases and discuss their implications.
First, it is important to note that the majority of the land purchased by Zionists were not sold by Palestinians, but rather by large absentee landlords, living mostly in Lebanon and Syria. Khalidi estimates that a little over the third (of the 5-7%) were sold by absentee landlords of Palestinian origin. And only 6% of the (5-7%) were sold by local landlords or peasants. These estimates are mostly corroborated by Walter Lehn and based on reports from the Jewish Agency that confirmed that the majority of land purchased was from large absentee landlords.
There is also evidence that suggests that these local sellers did not always wish to sell their land. For example, one mode of land extraction was when the Jewish National Fund gave loans to farmers with the precondition that their land would be used as collateral, and when the farmer ultimately defaulted on their payments, they would take possession of the land. In other cases, these peasants thought they were simply selling land to new neighbors. They did not know that they were selling their land for the erection of a new foreign colonial state that sought to dispossess them.
Furthermore, even if the percentage of the territories purchased by Zionist settlers was higher, this would not entitle them to sovereignty over it.
Ultimately, the question of Palestine is not about property rights. It is about settler colonialism and the attempted ethnocide of an entire people. Palestinians deserve to return to their homes and live in dignity, regardless how much private property they lost or didn’t lose.
