You will see a lot of Zionists blaming Hamas.
They forget that Israel literally controls everything that goes in and out of Gaza, including water, and limit Palestinians in Gaza access to shore water.
while you are at it, the westbank has no Hamas, why does Israel control more than 80% of the water there? Why do Palestinians suffer shortages in water there? Why there is no access to clear water in many areas there?
Heads up: they will blame Hamas( thatâ€™s not there) those who think they are smart manipulators will blame the PA, but they will never blame who controls the water: themselves.
