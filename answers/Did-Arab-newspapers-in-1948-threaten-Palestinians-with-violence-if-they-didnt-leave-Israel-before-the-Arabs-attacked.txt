No, this is a pure propaganda campaign to hide the original sin of Israelâ€™s genesis: The campaign of ethnic cleansing that took place before, during and after the war of 1948, and saw approximately 800,000 Indigenous Palestinian expelled from their homes, and over 530 Palestinian communities demolished.

Palestinian Refugees, 1948.
As a matter of fact, there were calls to the opposite, and borders were often closed to Palestinian refugees, especially men of fighting age. The only villages that were partially evacuated by the Arab armies for various reasons amount to less than 1% of the ethnically cleansed communities. In any case, even if there had been such a blanket order, the refugees still have a right to return irrespective of such details.

Original letter sent by the Arab Higher Committee to the Egyptian government urging it to refuse entry for refugees unless in emergency situations.

IDF operation order for the destruction of Palestinian villages in November 1948.
I addressed this previously thoroughly below:
Israeli narrative claims most Palestinians fled in 1948 because the Arab armies encouraged them to do so. Are there historical proofs of that?
Can somebody please provide evidence of Arab radio broadcasts or newspaper articles exhorting Palestinians to leave their villages during the 1948 War?
