The systematic spread of false narratives and manipulation of information by Zionists and their sympathizers to dehumanize Palestinians is a common method used by Zionists and garnering support for their brutal and heinous crimes. In the past few days, we have witnessed instances of such despicable conduct, as Israel has resorted to propaganda and lies to justify their genocidal actions against innocent Palestinians in Gaza.
One of the most prevalent claims that Israel made was that Hamas' fighters killed, beheaded and possibly burnt 40 'Israeli' babies with Zero proof. However, this turned out to be a lie, and the claim was later retracted after the PR damage has been done to the Palestinian cause and legitimate resistance.
Israeli news channel, i24NEWS_EN, posted a video from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, wherein a journalist claimed that the IOF had come across horrific scenes within the homes of the Kibbutz, which included families being slaughtered and infants with their heads cut off by Hamas.

Israeli News channel, i24 News.
i24 News has been alleged to propagate falsehoods and deception to justify heinous crimes committed by Israel against innocent Palestinians. A Haaretz investigation previously found that i24 News functions as a proxy for the Netanyahu family, with directives coming directly from the Israeli Prime Minister's office at times. Furthermore, i24 News has employed at least 35 veterans of the Israeli occupation forces as staff. For example:
Channa Rifkin is an i24News correspondent who transitioned from the channel's Social Media editor to the Israeli military, then returned to work for i24News.
Polina Gareav, who works as the Germany Correspondent for i24News while also working as a "social media guru" at DW, the German broadcaster where Palestinians were fired for social media posts. She began her career as the News Editor for the Israeli Military magazine.
David Matlin, the host of a daily flagship show on i24News, is a former Israeli military sergeant and the regional director for Israel lobby group AIPAC.
Eyal Pinko, who was the head of intelligence in the Israeli Navy before becoming the head of division in the Israeli prime minister's office, is another correspondent for the channel.
Daniel Tsemach, a former social media manager for the Israeli military, was also hired as a journalist by i24News. He later became the international media manager and spokesman for the Israeli state-owned arms firm Rafeal Systems.

Haaretz investigation on i24 News
The one behind the initial claim was none other than David Ben Zion, an Israeli soldier & extremist settler leader who incited violent riots by calling to "wipe out" Palestinians earlier this year and called for the destruction of Palestinian villages:
“Here in Hawara, the blood of our children, the residents of Samaria who were murdered here an hour ago, is spilled on the road. The village of Huwwara should be erased today. Enough with the talk of building and strengthening the settlement, the deterrence that was lost needs to be restored immediately, and there is no room for mercy.” Ben Zion.

"They chopped heads of children and women," says David Ben Zion, Deputy Commandee of Unit 71 while reporting from the 'massacre' in Kfar Aza in southern Israel.

David Ben Zion, the renowned Zionist extremist, full of smiles a few moments after he broke the “beheaded babies” story.
“We walked door to door, we killed a lot of terrorists. They are very bad. They cut heads of children, they cut heads of women. But we are stronger than them.” Furthermore, Ben Zion shows his true racism as he added, “We know that they are animals,” referring to Palestinians, “but we found that they don’t have any heart.”

The lie was also propagated and spread among other IOF soldiers, including Major General Itai Veruv who said “It’s not a war, it’s not a battlefield, it’s a massacre. You see the babies, their mothers and their fathers, in their bedrooms, and in their protected rooms, and how the terrorists killed them — it’s not a war.”

To make matters worse, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, claimed he had confirmation of decapitated babies, saying "I never really thought that I would see, have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children".

Joe Biden claiming that he had seen decapitated babies.
However, this claim was retracted by the US later when The Post reported on Wednesday that “A White House spokesperson later clarified that US officials and the president have not seen pictures or confirmed such reports independently”.
“The president based his comments about the alleged atrocities on the claims from Netanyahu’s spokesman and media reports from Israel, according to the White House.” Biden’s claims were featured on the front pages of Western newspapers, and reports of beheaded babies have been cited in some quarters as justification for revenge attacks and the collective punishment of civilians in Gaza.
On the 12th of October, a journalist asked John Kirby, the NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications: "And let me ask you one other. Has the United States independently verified the photos released by the Israeli Prime Minister’s Twitter account today showing the images of dead children? Kirby replied saying “I don’t think we’re going to be in the business of — of having to validate or approve those images. They’re coming from the Prime Minister of Israel. And we have absolutely no reason to doubt their authenticity."

What is even more interesting is that the Israeli government itself has not confirmed the specific claim that Hamas attackers cut off the heads of babies during their shock attack on Saturday. This was confirmed by Israeli official who told CNN, contradicting a previous public statement by the Prime Minister’s office.

CNN: “Israeli official says government cannot confirm babies were beheaded in Hamas attack”
Furthermore, Israeli journalist, Oren Ziv had also stated that there was no evidence or confirmation that babies were beheaded, adding that commanders “did not mention any such incidents”.

Additionally, Major Nir Dinar, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, told Insider on the 11th that the military won't seek further evidence for its claim that Hamas decapitated babies in Israel. He said it would be ‘disrespectful for the dead’ to do so. He said then that the IDF would not confirm the exact number of babies killed or how many had been beheaded. On the 10th, the spokesperson told Insider that although he hadn't seen images or videos himself, "soldiers on the ground who are there told me this." A later statement from Dinar said: ‘We can not confirm any numbers…’

Insider: ”IDF says Hamas fighters killed and decapitated babies at one kibbutz near the Gaza border”

Insider: IDF says it won't back up its claim that Hamas decapitated babies in Israel because it is 'disrespectful for the dead'
What is even more shocking is that Zionists had to resort to AI to spread their lies. One example is prominent propagandist and Zionist Ben Shapiro, who is known to have described Arabs as a people who “like to bomb crap and live in open sewage” while justifying illegal settlement and theft of Palestinian land, had generated a fake AI image of a burnt baby. This was instantly and easily revealed as a fake image by social media users.

Additionally, the CNN journalist who spread the lie regarding Hamas beheading Israeli babies, Sara Sidner, had taken to Twitter to apologize for the false incitement and propaganda.

All of this was happening whilst the illegitimate state of 'Israel' was actively committing war crimes and killing Palestinian children and infants, with almost no to little reporting on the matter by western media. It got to the point where they used Injured Palestinian children on their headlines! For example, 'The Times’ new headline is “Israel shows mutilated babies,” but shows an image of Palestinian children wounded due to Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.'

The Times article, titled “Israel shows mutilated babies”…

…yet shows an image of Palestinian children wounded due to Israeli airstrikes.
So far, the terrorist state of Israel has murdered 1,900 Gazans, 614 of which are children (October 14th), this could be confirmed using 3rd party international health organizations, and yet the world is silent. The horrific and indiscriminate targeting of civilians with a collective punishment operation against 2 million Palestinians in Gaza is a clear violation of international humanitarian law and they're beyond a shred of doubt documented (Viewer Discretion is Advised):
