Hello. Thank you so much for standing in solidarity with our just cause. To help Palestinians, keep talking about their daily oppression under Israel‘s apartheid so more people can see what is happening. If you live in the west, I recommend you follow or join the BDS campaign to boycott Israel‘s products until they adhere to international law and give Palestinians their basic human rights. Through your caring inquiry here on Quora and your honest moral and humanitarian intentions, you are already helping Palestinians.
Regards,
-A Palestinian living under Israel‘s apartheid.
