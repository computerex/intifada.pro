The UN unjustly recommended partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Arab states against the wishes of the indigenous Palestinian majority who owned more than 93% of historic Palestine in 1947. Almost immediately after, Zionist militias began massacring Palestinians, forcing Palestinians from their homes, stealing their land and property, and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee.
By the end of 1948, Israel had pushed out or forced most Palestinians to flee from almost all of Palestine, destroyed hundreds of Palestinian cities, towns, and villages, and refused to allow Palestinian refugees to return home. Palestinians mark 1948 as the beginning of their Nakba, which means “catastrophe”.

BY THE NUMBERS:
The UN proposed taking 55% of Palestine for a Jewish state even though Jewish people were only one-third of the population and owned less than 7% of the land.
Israel stole even more Palestinian land than proposed, establishing its rule over 78% of Palestine.
Israel pushed out or forced at least 75% of Palestinians to flee. From an original 750,000 refugees in 1948 to more than 5 million today, Israel denies Palestinian refugees their right to return home.
Israel destroyed between 400-500 Palestinian cities, towns, and villages, often wiping them off the map completely or settling Israelis in stolen Palestinian homes.
