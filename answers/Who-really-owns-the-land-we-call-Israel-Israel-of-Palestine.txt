Definitely Palestinian Muslims and Christians.
Jews, owned less than 7% of Palestine ( It should be noted that the majority of those lands were bought during the 3 decades under British rule by Zionists from absentee land lords. The Palestinian peasants living and cultivating those lands were kicked from them and forced in slums), of which only 44% was utilized for agrarian activity. (Survey of Palestine p. 376).
It should be noted that Jews constituted 1/3 of the total Populace in 1948, and only 1/3 of those Jews in Palestine (1/9 of the total population) were citizens; the remainder were either illegal immigrants or simply immigrants granted entry to Palestine in order to flee German and European crimes.
