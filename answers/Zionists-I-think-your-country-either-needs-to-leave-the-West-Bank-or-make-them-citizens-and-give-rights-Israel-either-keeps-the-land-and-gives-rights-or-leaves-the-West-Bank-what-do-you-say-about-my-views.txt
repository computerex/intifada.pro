Zionists want maximum Palestinian land with minimum Palestinians. They like the current status quo, which is apartheid. I mean, look at the Zionist answers here; they made their case for me as a Palestinian. They completely went loco, calling the OP "ignorant" , "none of your business", "you do not understand," ‚Äúgod gave it to us‚Äù, and other dishonest justifications, while others started harassing the OP. One is saying "we tried to leave the West Bank," yet looking at the number of illegal Israeli settlements expanding on Palestinian lands says the complete opposite. Another answer says, "We left Gaza, and look what happened," but forgets to say that they were illegally settling on Palestinian lands in Gaza and moved to illegal settlements on Palestinian lands in the West Bank. Israel moved 8000 illegal settler from Gaza and added them to hundreds of thousands of illegal Israeli settlers on Palestinian lands in the Westbank to kill a future Palestinian state. Notice how Zionists overlook that, take a snapshot from the full story, and completely ignore the numbers. Gaza is also still under total illegal siege by Israel and is still occupied per international law. Another Zionist answer talks about ethnically cleansing native Palestinians AGAIN to Jordan.
The real problem lies in Zionism, aka Jewish supremacy. As long as Zionism and its deceit exists, peace and justice will never prevail.

I hope you have a Good day, OP. I also hope we Palestinians may one day find peace without this lunacy.
