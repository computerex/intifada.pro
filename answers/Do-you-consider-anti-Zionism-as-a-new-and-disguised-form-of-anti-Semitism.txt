Zionism was the secular Jewish nationalist movement that arose in Europe in the 19th century as one response to Christian European persecution of Jews. It eventually fixed on the goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, and serves today as Israel’s ruling ideology.
As a political program, Zionism has always had supporters, both Jewish and non-Jewish, and opponents, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Indeed, there is a long history of antisemitic support for Zionism, from British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour, who in the 19th century saw Zionism as a means to divert immigration of progressive Eastern European Jews from England to Palestine, to white supremacist Richard Spencer, who expresses admiration for Israel and has dubbed himself a “white Zionist.”


Palestinians oppose Zionism because it destroyed their society and has killed, maimed, or ruined the lives of countless Palestinians, and continues to do so. Others oppose Zionism for the simple fact that creating a state “for” one ethnic or religious group in a diverse society is necessarily racist.
Antisemitism - hatred against Jews as Jews - like any form of racism, is abhorrent and must be condemned and actively opposed wherever it appears.
Unfounded accusations of antisemitism against those who oppose Zionism and/or Israeli state policies and practices, however, obscures the real dangers of rising white nationalism, and weakens anti-racist struggle.

Elected officials should oppose any attempts to unfairly brand critics of Israel and of Zionism as antisemitic, while at the same time denouncing real antisemitism and its rise among white supremacists.
