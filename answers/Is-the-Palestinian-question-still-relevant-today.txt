Yes, the Palestinian people still suffer under Israeli colonialism in every part of Palestine. The liberation of all oppressed peoples should always be “relevant” to people of conscience. Despite the dubious claims that the Palestinian question is irrelevant today, it is still a cause that can marshal support and solidarity all across the globe. It has become a symbol for resistance against oppression and imperialism.

If the Palestinian question was truly something in the past, there would not be so much effort on part of Israel to censor and penalize solidarity actions, such as the BDS campaign all over the world.
