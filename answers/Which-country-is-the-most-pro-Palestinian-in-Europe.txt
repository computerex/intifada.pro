Ireland.

The Irish support Palestinians due to the shared experience of oppression under Imperialism between both nations which has led to a joint history of solidarity.

Like the occupied north of Ireland, the state of Israel was founded on the basis of a far-right ideology that deemed the lives of the natives to be subhuman; in Ireland, this was Ulster Loyalism, in Palestine, this was Zionism.

Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, the predominantly Catholic Nationalists faced discrimination in housing and employment from the predominantly Protestant Unionist ruling class, descended from Scottish and English settlers in the 17th century. In Israel, the native Palestinians faced similar discrimination from European Zionist settlers.

In occupied Ireland this discrimination was one of the main catalysts for the outbreak of violence known as ‚Äòthe Troubles‚Äô in 1969, and likewise in occupied Palestine this resulted in the first Intifada in 1987.

This strikingly similar history between both nations has led to long-standing solidarity between both countries; Palestinian flags and murals are a regular sight on the streets of Nationalist areas of occupied Ireland, and in 1981, following the H-Block hunger strikes which led to the death of 10 Republican POWs, Palestinian POWs in the Nafha Zionist jail smuggled out a letter of solidarity read at a rally in Belfast.
