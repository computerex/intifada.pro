Has it never once sounded suspicious to you how Israelis focus on the “peace offers” that were refused by the Palestinians, but never once discussed the actual parameters or substance in detail?
Because when these parameters are discussed, it becomes clear that these are terms nobody could accept. For example, even when Palestinians accepted the 1967 borders, a very limited return of refugees, and other compromises, this was still not good enough for Israel, which sought to shrink the Palestinian Bantustan even further and deny any real sovereignty to the supposed Palestinian state. These arrangements seek to formalize the status quo with cosmetic changes. Netanyahu promised no Palestinian state will emerge, and in the case of any limited self-rule arrangement for the Palestinians, he spoke about a permanent IDF presence in the West Bank, as well as Israeli control of the borders and airspace. These are the amazing “opportunities” that Palestinians have been declining, and as a result are being painted as warmongering rejectionists for doing so. As it stands, Palestinian aspirations cannot exceed the ceiling of Israeli table scraps. Furthermore, this talking point purposefully ignores Palestinian counter-offers and proposals that Israel has rejected over the years, solely to paint Palestinians in a bad light.
There are many examples of Israel deliberately seeking war to maximize territorial expansion. There have also been many Arab peace offers that Israel chose to neglect or reject. As a matter of fact, Palestinians have compromised tremendously during negotiations, and Israel has never -not even under Rabin- committed to a sovereign Palestinian state.
