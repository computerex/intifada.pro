Advocates of Israel often claim that there is a global bias against Israel, whether it be at the UN, or from the various human rights organizations documenting Israeli violations. Naturally, the implication here being that this bias is purely a result of hatred and antisemitism.
The idea that Israel is being singled out and treated unfairly is especially ubiquitous when it comes to discussing it in the media. However, it should be noted that although Israel is one of the world’s leading countries when it comes to violating and ignoring UNSC resolutions, it is still afforded a special place among the nations and considered a democratic civilized first world country and is granted special privileges, trade offers and partnerships not available to any other serial violator of human rights. If Israel is being singled out for anything, it is for its impunity to any real consequences for its serious human rights violations.
Any Israeli claims of bias in the media should be taken with a mountain’s worth of salt. Let us keep in mind that Israelis are incredibly quick to label anyone questioning them in any way as an enemy. I would like to remind you that “The most anti-Israel US President in history” Barack Obama still managed to approve a whopping 38 billion dollar arm package to Israel. His crime was that he also managed to slip in an ode to human rights and feigned ‘concern’ regarding Israel’s constant violation of international law, naturally without doing anything about it.
To put it mildly, Israelis don’t have a track record of having the most objective view of issues relating to them. Take for example the fact that the majority of Jewish Israelis don’t even believe that the West Bank is occupied territory at all. According to this standard, anybody reporting on the occupation of Palestinians, or the illegal land-grabs and construction of colonies on Palestinian land will be looked at as anti-Israel. But is this an anti-Israel bias? Or is it simply a declaration of facts?
There is a common misconception, especially in the US, that in order to be objective you need to be neutral. These concepts can be connected but they do not necessarily follow from each other. Having two points of view does not mean that both points of view are equally legitimate or based in reality, or that the actual truth has to be somewhere between them. For example, you can of course bring two opposing sides to discuss if climate change is real or not, but treating them both as equally valid and of equal worth when one is backed by scientific consensus and the other isn’t is not a fair and balanced representation of reality. It is a false equation of two sides simply for being two different sides, and actually gives legitimacy to reactionary and anti-scientific positions.
Similarly, reporting that Israel is ramping up its colonization efforts in the West Bank by expanding its settlements is an accurate representation of what is occurring on the ground. It is not a biased to say Israel is violating international law when it has been proven to be fact and is backed by mountains of all kinds of evidence.
But let us move away from the realm of subjective Israeli perceptions of persecution and see if there is any empirical evidence for bias in any form.
What does the data say?
Luckily for us, 416 Labs has already done this hard work for us, and monitored major US newspapers using Natural Language Processing techniques to see how biased they are on the question of Palestine. If you’ve been in any way following what is going on in Palestine, I’m certain that the following will be of no great surprise to you.
The study found that Israeli sources are near two and half times (250%) more likely to be quoted than Palestinian ones, meaning that Israelis have had a huge advantage in framing how the US views current events in Palestine. It also found that over the last 50-year period, there has been a near 85% decline in the instances of the word occupation and its affiliated unigrams in Israel centric headlines. In the Palestine corpus, there has been a 65% decline in the word occupation and its affiliated unigrams, meaning that even mentioning the word occupation is becoming rarer and rarer. It seems even acknowledging what the Palestinians are going through is deemed too far for the editors and writers of these publications.
Another finding is that Israeli headlines were statistically more positive than Palestinian ones for all publications, except for the Washington Post. Mentions related to Palestinian aspirations, such as “Palestinian Refugees” have declined by 93% over the 50-year period.
The study concluded that the:
“results..strongly support previous academic literature that assesses that the U.S. mainstream media’s coverage of the conflict favours Israel in terms of both the sheer quantity of stories covered, and by providing more opportunities to the Israelis to amplify their point of view. The overall sentiment of those stories calculated from the headlines of the five major U.S. newspapers was consistently more negative for Palestinian stories. On the other hand, the Palestinian narrative is highly underrepresented, and several key topics that help to identify the conflict in all its significance, remain understated.”
This is hardly the only study on the matter, for example Jonas Xavier Caballero investigated the impact of media bias on news coverage during Operation Cast Lead (2014), the 3-week Israeli military assault on the Gaza Strip that resulted in the death of nearly 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. It found that although Palestinians died at a rate 106 times more than Israelis, the New York Times engaged in a practice of media bias that resulted in coverage of only 3% of Palestinian deaths in the headlines and first paragraphs. Upon analyzing the articles’ entireties, this study found that the New York Times covered 431% of Israeli deaths and only 17% of Palestinian deaths, a ratio of 25:1. Only 17% of Palestinian children deaths were covered in the full articles. This means that every Israeli death was covered multiple times in multiple pieces, whereas less than a fifth of Palestinian deaths were covered at all.
Another study by Jacek Glowacki found that Palestinian deaths were usually reported as “accidents”, while Israeli deaths were almost always reported as “victims of terrorism”.
Perhaps one of the most infamous examples of the New York Time’s distortions of Palestinian death and Israeli war crimes was the case of the Israeli bombing of a cafe in Gaza which was hosting a World Cup viewing event. Instead of reporting on it like any other event, clearly identifying what occurred, they chose to run this craven headline:

“Missile at Beachside Gaza Cafe Finds Patrons Poised for World Cup”
As if the missile was its own entity which decided by itself to blow up innocent Palestinians, completely removing the perpetrators of this horrible crime from the picture. This style is often used in US journalism to obfuscate reality, such as when they use the ridiculous “officer involved shooting” to cover the fact that the police murdered yet another person in cold blood. The title was changed after public outcry, but you can see the old title in the tweet.
Another egregious example of this style of headline writing comes following the bombing of four Palestinian boys playing football on the beach in Gaza. Instead of fulfilling their journalistic duty, the New York Times chose to report this heinous crime under the following headline:

“Boys Drawn to Gaza Beach, and Into Center of Mideast Strife.”
Notice the passive framing. Suddenly, it becomes the boys fault for being drawn to the beach, and there is absolutely no mention of what happened to them, and who caused it. The general “Mideast Strife” becomes responsible, relieving the IDF trooper pulling the trigger from any culpability.
These are just a few examples of how the media implicitly influences our perception of Palestinians and Israelis, and slowly builds a narrative that frames everything coming out of Palestine. This narrative constantly dehumanizes Palestinians, and portrays any criticism of Israel, no matter how based in reality, as a bloodthirsty smear emanating from antisemitism.
There is absolutely no media bias against Israel in the West, there is, however, ample academic and empirical evidence that there is a strong anti-Palestinian bias. Factual reporting on Israeli violations is not a bias, it is reality. Perhaps reality has an anti-Israel bias too.
