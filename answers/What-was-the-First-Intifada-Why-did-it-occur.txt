36 years ago, a large-scale popular uprising by Palestinians began against Israel's then 20-year-old military occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza. Sparked by an incident in which four Palestinians were hit and killed by an Israeli driving in Gaza on December 8, 1987, Palestinian frustration at living under repressive Israeli military rule and Israel's growing colonial settlement enterprise erupted, grabbing international headlines and drawing attention to the plight of Palestinians living in the occupied territories.
During the First Intifada (1987–1993), Palestinians employed tactics such as unarmed demonstrations, including rock throwing against soldiers, commercial strikes, a refusal to pay taxes to Israeli authorities, and other acts of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance. They were coordinated largely by grassroots ad hoc committees of Palestinians in the occupied territories rather than the PLO leadership abroad.

In response, Israeli soldiers use brutal force to repress the mostly unarmed popular rebellion. Then-Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin implements the infamous "broken bones" policy, ordering security forces to break the limbs of rock-throwing Palestinians and other demonstrators.

More than 1000 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during the First Intifada, including 237 children under the age of 17. Many tens of thousands more were injured.
According to an estimate by the Swedish branch of Save the Children, as many as 29,900 children required medical treatment for injuries caused by beatings from Israeli soldiers during the first two years of the Intifada alone. Nearly a third of them are aged ten or under. Save the Children also estimates that between 6500-8500 Palestinian minors were wounded by Israeli gunfire in the first two years of the Intifada.
In 2000 it was revealed that between 1988 and 1992 Israel's internal security force, the Shin Bet, systematically tortured Palestinians using methods that go beyond what is allowable under government guidelines for "moderate physical pressure," Israel's official euphemism for torture. These methods included violent shaking, tying prisoners into painful positions for long periods, subjecting them to extreme heat and cold, and severe beatings, including kicking. At least 10 Palestinians died and hundreds of others were maimed as a result.
Approximately 120,000 Palestinians were imprisoned by Israel during the First Intifada.
In 1987, Hamas was founded in Gaza, formed from the Palestinian branch of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. During the 1980s, Israeli authorities encouraged and tacitly supported the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, viewing them as a counterweight to the secular nationalists of the PLO, part of a strategy of divide and conquer.
In 1992, in the face of protests from the international community, including the UN Security Council through Resolution 799, Israel deported more than 400 suspected members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad to southern Lebanon, including one of the founders of Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' top leader in Gaza today. Refused entry by the Lebanese government, which doesn't want to confer legitimacy on Israel's illegal deportation of Palestinians, the exiles spent a harsh winter outside in a no-man's land limbo. Many observers considered this a turning point for Hamas, whose members were given assistance to survive by the Lebanese paramilitary group Hezbollah. In addition to basic sustenance, Hezbollah gave the Palestinians advice and military training honed during a decade of struggle against Israel's occupation of Lebanon that began following the bloody Israeli invasion of 1982. Under pressure from the US, Israel agreed to let the exiled Palestinians return to the occupied territories in 1993.
The outbreak of the First Intifada surprises nearly everyone, including Israeli military and intelligence officials, and the leadership of the PLO, which is then based in Tunisia after being forced out of its base in Lebanon in 1982 by Israel's invasion.
The First Intifada gradually tapered off in the face of brutal Israeli repression and political co-optation by the PLO, ending by 1993.
The First Intifada creates immense international sympathy for the Palestinian cause, and leads to international pressure on Israel to address Palestinian demands for freedom and self-determination.
