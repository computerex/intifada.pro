Not really. “Conflict” implies rough parity between two or more parties to a dispute. But that is not how we typically describe an encounter in which one very powerful party is inflicting violent harm on another nearly defenseless victim. If that victim is desperately, even violently, resisting that assault, we do not call that a “conflict,” even though both are using violence.
Israel is a nuclear-armed regional military super-power, with a strong economy and substantial backing from the Global North. The Palestinians are people lacking a functioning state with no formal military at all.
