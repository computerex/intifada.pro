Asking the victims what will they do to those who committed crimes against them, and are still doing so is unfair and unjust. Palestinians have suffered immensely and paid a heavy price for what Europeans did to their Jewish citizens (Zionism was mainly created as a response to European antisemitism). With that being said, and despite all of the pain; the Palestinian mainstream does not and won't condone massive ethnic cleansing and massacres such as that which Israelis and Zionists have perpetrated against them. It should be noted that Palestinian Jews in Nablus stayed put mostly even during the Nakba; and those who left did on their own. Palestinians, being majority Muslims and culturally Arabs, have a long history and track record which proves exactly the opposite. Looking at Islamic leaders like Omar Ibn al-Khatab's and Saladinâ€˜s conquest of Jerusalem are solid proof of how Arabs and Muslims treated their defeated subjects fairly during the Byzantines and the Crusades respectively. Ironically, many of today's Christian Palestinians trace their roots to the Crusades, such as the famous Rock family of Jaffa. In other words, if freeing Palestine would imply perpetrating war crimes similar to the ones perpetrated against the Palestinian people, Palestinians will wait for another Omar or Saladin to right the wrongs of the past.
We are not Zionists. We are not racists. We only want our rights. We want justice, and freedom.
