Most definitely not. This myth that Zionists propagate saying that Palestinians living in occupied Palestine “Israel” call themselves Arab Israelis , not Palestinians is pure propaganda. The problem lies in the fact that Zionists spread this propaganda.
As a Palestinian it shocked me how this lie is being propagated. It’s not true and it’s rather ironic as someone who half of his family live there ( my family numbers between 2000–2500 members) The Israeli citizenship is forced on some of us, if we don’t accept it we are expelled from our homes and lands. We however say it loudly and proudly : we are Palestinian.
It hurts me that I’m obliged to bring studies that validates this common and well known information for us Palestinians:


Palestinian citizens of Israel mainly identify themselves as Palestinian. (Alexander Bligh (2 August 2004). The Israeli Palestinians: An Arab Minority in the Jewish State. Routledge.)


The recent events that occurred all over historic Palestine including lydd, ramlah, Akka , Um-fahem, yaffa, Nazareth , and elsewhere sent a straight forward message : We are Palestinian, we will never abandon our Palestinian identity, and we will always stand with each other.
