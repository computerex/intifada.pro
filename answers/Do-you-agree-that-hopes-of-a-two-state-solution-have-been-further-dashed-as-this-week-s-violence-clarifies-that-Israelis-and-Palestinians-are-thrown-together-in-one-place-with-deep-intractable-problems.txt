Israel killed the two-state solution by building illegal settlements and putting more than 700 thousand illegal settlers in the WB. Its policy in enforcing apartheid and the bantustanization of Palestinian areas was understood by many Palestinians, the 2 state solution was a lie made by the Israeli government to continue its colonial Endeavour.
To achieve justice and peace for Palestinians and all in Palestine:
-The racist Zionist ideology should be abolished.
-The immediate and unconditional end of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, dismantling of all settlements, and return of land and water resources.
-The immediate dismantling of the Apartheid Wall and compensation for the suffering and losses of the Palestinian people.
-The immediate implementation of full Palestinian Right-of-Return to their original homes and properties.
-The return of stolen lands and full restitution for more than 73 years of suffering.
-The establishment of a secular, democratic state with laws based on citizenship, not ethnicity or religion, in the whole region of historic Palestine, with full political and civil rights for all.
To aid in accomplishing all of this: there should be a total economic, cultural, and academic boycott of Israel.
