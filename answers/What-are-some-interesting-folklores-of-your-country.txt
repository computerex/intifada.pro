There are many folktales from my homeland, Palestine. These are traditional stories that passed down through generations in Palestinian culture. They often feature themes of resilience, community, and morality. These tales include characters like clever animals, brave heroes, and supernatural beings, and they reflect the historical and cultural experiences of our people. These stories have been shared orally and through written literature, preserving the rich heritage of the Palestinian culture.
I will share with you the old Palestinian tale of “Half-a-Halfling”:
Once upon a time there was a man who was married to two women. One of them was his first cousin and the other was a stranger, and neither of them could get pregnant.
"I'm going to visit the sheikh," he said to himself one day, "and maybe for the sake of Allah he'll give me some medicine to make these women conceive." He went to the sheikh and said, "I want you to give me a medicine that'll make my wives get pregnant."
"Go to such and such a mountain," the sheikh advised, "and there you'll find a ghoul. Say to him, 'I want two pomegranates to feed my wives so they can get pregnant,' and see what he says to you."
The man went forth, and came upon the ghoul, He approached him immediately shaved his beard, trimmed his eyebrows, and said, "Peace be upon you!" "And to you, peace!" replied the ghoul. "Had not your salaam come before your request, I would've munched your bones so loud my brother who lives on the next mountain would've heard it. What do you want?"
The man told him what he wanted, and the ghoul said, "Go to the next mountain over there, and you'll find my elder brother. Ask him, and he'll tell you what to do."
The man went to the next mountain over and found the ghoul. He did with him as he had done with his brother. Then he said, "Peace be upon you!" "And to you, peace? replied the ghoul. "Had not your salaam come before your request, I would've munched your bones so loud my sister who lives on the next mountain would've heard it. What can I do for you?" The man told him what he wanted, and the ghoul said, "Go to my sister on the next mountain over there, and she'll tell you what to do.”
The man did as he was told, and found the ghouleh grinding wheat, her breasts thrown over her shoulders. He came forward and sucked on her right breast, then on her left. After he did this, he put a handful of her flour in his mouth.
"You've sucked at my right breast," declared the ghouleh, "and now you're dearer to me than my son Ismail. You've sucked at my left breast, and now you're dearer than my son Nassar. And now that you've eaten my flour, you're dearer than my own children. What can I do for you?"
"I want two pomegranates to feed my wives so they can have children," he answered.
"Go to that orchard over there," she said. "You'll find a ghoul sleeping, using one ear for a mattress and the other for a blanket. Pick two pomegranates and run away as fast as you can."
Having done as he was told, the man took the two pomegranates and started on his way home. As he was traveling, he became hungry. "I'm going to eat part of my cousin's pomegranate," he thought to himself. "She's my cousin and won't get angry if I offer her only half a pomegranate."
When he reached home, he gave his other wife the whole pomegranate and his cousin The Half one. They became pregnant at the same time. The stranger gave birth to two twin boys, and he called one Hasan and the other Hussein. His cousin gave birth to half a human being, and they called him Half-a-Halfling.
The boys grew up. One day they told their father they wanted to go hunting. Hasan and Hussien said they each wanted a mare and a gun, and the father consented and granted them their wish. Half-a-Halfling said he wanted a lame and mangy she-goat and a wooden poker. He got what he had asked for, and the boys all set out together to hunt. Hasan and Hussein fired their shotguns, but they did not hit anything. Half-a-Halfling, meanwhile, would lie in wait on the ground until the deer came near, then he would hit and break their legs.
"Give us the deer you've hunted," said Hasan and Hussein n, "so we can take them home and say we killed them."
"All right," he replied, "but on one condition only. I'll heat my brand, and brand each of you on the backside."
They agreed, and he branded both of them. They took the deer and gave them to their mother, who cooked them and threw away the bones at the doorstep of Half-a-Halfling's mother. She started to cry. When Half-a-Halting saw her crying, he asked, "Why are you crying?"
"Look!" she answered. "Your brothers Hasan and Husen were able to hunt deer, but not you."
"What!" he cried. "Do you think they killed the deer? You'd better go and see my brand on their behinds." His mother went, and she could see the brand.
The following day they went hunting again. The sun set while they were still away from town. They came to another town and found no one there except a ghouleh chasing a rooster.
"Welcome to my nephews!" she said when she saw them. Tying their horses and the she-goat in front of the house, she invited them in, and made dinner and fed them.
"What do your horses eat?" she asked.
"They eat hulled barley and pure milk," they answered. She brought food for the horses. Then she asked Half-a-Halfling, "What does your she-goat eat?"
"Bran left over from sifting," he answered, "and water left over from kneading."
She put food in front of the she-goat and laid out bedding for the brothers to sleep on. Hasan and Hussein went to sleep on the floor, but Half-a-Halfling said, "I can't sleep on the floor." Seeing a reed basket hanging from the ceiling, he said, "I'll sleep in this basket. But first you must give me a waterskin and a handful of fava beans for munching." He pierced the waterskin and hung it above his head and let it drip on him, as he sat in the basket munching the fava beans.
In a while the ghouleh, thinking they were asleep, started jumping around and singing, "O my teeth get sharper and sharper, for Hasan and his brother Hussein! “Now, Half-a-Halfling was awake, and he heard her.
"How am I going to sleep?" he said. "And how am I going to sleep, when my belly has no food in it to keep?"
"What do you want to eat?" asked the ghouleh, and he answered, "I want a stuffed rooster so I can eat it and go to sleep."
She prepared the rooster for him, and he ate it and climbed back into the basket. Again the ghouleh started prancing around, singing, "O my teeth get sharper and sharper, for Hasan and Hussein his brother!"
Half-a-Halfling jumped up and said, "How am I going to sleep? And how am I going to sleep, when my belly has no food in it to keep?"
"What do you want to eat?" she asked, and he answered, "I want a lamb, stuffed and roasted to a turn."
By the time she finished preparing the lamb, the sun had risen.
"We want water so we can wash," the boys said. When she had gone out to fetch the water, Half-a-Halfling said to his brothers, "You'd better get up! This woman is a ghouleh." They got up, mounted their animals, and ran away. When she came back and found them gone, she called out, "O milk, thicken! thicken! and tie up their joints so they can't move." The horses came immediately to a stop and would not budge. They got down and mounted behind their brother on the lame she-goat, and he prodded the animal with the poker, calling out, "O flint, spark and spark! O bran, fly and fly!" The she-goat flew with them and brought them home, while the ghouleh caught up with the horses and gobbled them up.
The father was very pleased with Half-a-Halfling, who was able to save his brothers. from the clutches of the ghouleh.
"And
what would you say," the boy asked, "if I were to bring the ghouleh herself right here?"
"We'd confess you're cleverer than both your brothers if you could do that," replied the parents.
Half-a-Halfling went and bought a donkey, and loaded it with a huge box filled with halvah. "Here's the halvah! Here's the halvah? he cried out when he reached the ghouleh's house. She came out and asked how much it was. He answered, you might say, "A piaster for a quarter of a kilo."
She ate one quarter, then two and three, but she was still hungry.
"What do you say to getting into the box," he suggested, "and eating as much as you want. We'll figure out what you owe me later." She agreed and got into the box. He closed the lid on her, securing it with a rope, and started moving. She was too busy eating to notice. When he approached their town, he called out, "Light the fire and let the flames rise! I've brought the ghouleh herself. And let him who loves the Prophet bring a load of wood and a burning coal!"
"What're you saying?" asked the ghouleh.
"I was saying," he answered, "spread the silk and put the silk away! I've brought you the princess, daughter of the prince."
When the fire was big enough, they threw the box in it and rid themselves of the ghouleh and her evil.
The bird has flown, and a good evening to all!
