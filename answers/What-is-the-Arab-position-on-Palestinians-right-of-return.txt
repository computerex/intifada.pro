The Arab position on the Palestinians' right of return is generally supportive of the idea that Palestinian refugees have a right to return to their homes and properties that they were ethnically cleansed from between 1947–1950 and subsequent conflicts by European Zionists. This principle is rooted in the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, which emphasizes the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and receive compensation.
Arab countries often express solidarity with the Palestinian cause and advocate for the implementation of the right of return as part of a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian “conflict”. They argue that the recognition and realization of the right of return are fundamental to achieving a just and lasting resolution that addresses the historical grievances of Palestinian refugees.
