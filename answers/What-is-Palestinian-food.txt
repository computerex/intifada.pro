Palestinian cuisine has been shaped by a rich history of cultural influences, including the indigenous Palestinian culture, Arab and Islamic traditions, Ottoman cuisine, and the culinary customs of neighboring Mediterranean and Levantine countries.

The region that is now Palestine has been inhabited by various civilizations over the centuries, including the Canaanites, Philistines, Israelites, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Ottomans, and British. Each of these groups has contributed to the development of Palestinian cuisine.
One of the most important crops in ancient Palestine was wheat, which was used to make bread and other baked goods. Other staple crops included barley, lentils, and chickpeas, which were used to make dishes like hummus and falafel.
The region was also known for its olives, which were used to produce olive oil, a staple ingredient in Palestinian cooking. Grapes were another important crop, which were used to make wine and vinegar, as well as raisins and other dried fruits.
Spices were also an important part of ancient Palestinian cuisine, and the region was known for its production and trade of spices like cinnamon, coriander, cumin, and cardamom. These spices were used to flavor dishes like rice, meat, and fish, as well as sweets and desserts.
Palestinian food is a delicious and diverse cuisine that reflects the culinary traditions of the Palestinian people, who have inhabited the region for thousands of years. Palestinian food is characterized by the use of fresh, local ingredients, and a variety of spices and herbs that give the dishes their distinct flavor and aroma.
Some of the most popular ingredients in Palestinian cuisine include olive oil, chickpeas, lentils, eggplants, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and a variety of herbs and spices such as mint, parsley, cumin, coriander, and sumac. These ingredients are used to create a variety of dishes, including salads, dips, soups, stews, and grilled meats.
Palestinian cuisine also reflects the agricultural diversity of the region, which includes fertile farmland, lush valleys, and abundant seafronts. Popular dishes include stuffed vegetables (such as grape leaves or zucchini), roasted meats (such as lamb or chicken), grilled vegetables, dips and spreads (such as hummus or baba ghanoush), and various breads (such as pita or laffa).
Rice and variations of kibbee are common in the Galilee. The West Bank engages primarily in heavier meals involving the use of taboon bread, rice and meat, and coastal plain inhabitants frequent fish, other seafood, and lentils. The Gaza cuisine is a variation of the Levant cuisine, but is more diverse in seafood and spices. Gaza's inhabitants heavily consume chili peppers too. Meals are usually eaten in the household but dining out has become prominent particularly during parties where light meals like salads, bread dips and skewered meats are served.

The area is also home to many desserts, ranging from those made regularly and those that are commonly reserved for the holidays. Most Palestinian sweets are pastries filled with either sweetened cheeses, dates or various nuts such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios. Beverages could also depend on holidays such as during Ramadan, where carob, tamarind and apricot juices are consumed at sunset. Coffee is consumed throughout the day and liquor is not very prevalent among the population, however, some alcoholic beverages such as arak or beer are consumed by Christians.
After Palestine was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century CE, it became part of a Bilad al-Sham under the name Jund Filastin (The soldiers of Palestine). Therefore, many aspects of Palestinian cuisine are similar to the cuisine of Syria—especially in the Galilee. Modern Syrian-Palestinian dishes have been generally influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups: the Arabs, the Persian-influenced Arabs (Iraqis) and the Turks.
In the 10th century, the Palestinian Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi said this of Palestine's foods
From Palestine comes olives, dried figs, raisins, the carob fruit... from Jerusalem comes cheeses and the celebrated raisins of the species known as Ainuni and Duri, excellent apples... also pine nuts of the kind called 'Kuraish-bite', and their equal is not found elsewhere... from Sughar and Baysan come dates, the treacle called Dibs 1
Until around the 1950s–60s, the main ingredients for rural Palestinian cuisine were vegetables, Zait o Zaatar (olive oil and thyme), oregano and bread baked in a simple oven called a taboon.
Author G. Robinson Lees, writing in 1905, observed that "The oven is not in the house, it has a building of its own, the joint property of several families whose duty is to keep it always hot." 2
The Zionist movement has always worked hard to justify why it was more deserving of Palestine than the natives living there. At the beginning, this took the form of appealing to Europe’s colonial expansionism, arguing that the Zionist movement could bring this backward land into the modern era. They also argued that this new Zionist state would serve as a bulwark for Europe against the barbaric east. This logic animated much of their early endeavors, such as founding a colonial trust and establishing a colonization department.
With time, and especially after the two world wars, the idea of colonialism began to fall out of the realm of the acceptable. Even traditionally colonial powers such as France and Britain sought to camouflage their endeavors under different designations such as “mandates” and “protectorates”. This, too, caught up to Israel and the Zionist movement, which had until then relied on projecting an image of European civilization in a deeply uncivilized area. As Yitzhak Gruenbaum, a member of the World Zionist Organization executive once argued:
“We, the Jews, are twentieth-century people of Europe, whereas the Arab population is still at the developmental level of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.” and, as “people of Europe, we wish to create a European economy here. We believe that the Mandate government must conduct its affairs based on the point of view that Palestine is a European country like England or its dominions.” 3

To combat this negative perception, Israel would begin to coopt some aspects of the natives as their own, especially regarding cuisine and some symbolic markers. Suddenly, Falafel and Hummus become “Israeli” staples, when most of the Zionist settlers had never even heard of them before arriving in Palestine. This would later develop to include other cultural markers, such as Palestinian Dabkeh, and producing an Israeli version of a Palestinian Kuffiyeh and claiming it has historical significance.
